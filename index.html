<body>
	<h1>I will now guide you through the tricky process of creating milk steak</h1>
	<h2>What you'll need (Ingredients)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1 medium (8.8oz) juicy piece of meat</li>
		<li>2 cups whole milk</li>
		<li>1/4 cup honey (Ideally collected by hand from your local hornets nest)</li>
		<li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
		<li>1/2 tsp nutmeg</li>
		<li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
		<li>1/2 of jelly beans (most important part</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Step 1: Combine milk, honey, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla to a pan on the stove</p>
	<p>Step 2: Heat and stir until honey has disolved. Don't stop stirring to check your match.com</p>
	<p>Step 3: Once honey has disolved, allow mixture to boil</p>
	<p>Step 4: Place juicy meat in said boiling mixture</p>
	<p>Step 5: Bring the liquid back to a boil? I don't think it ever stopped. Anyways, don't even do that, bring the heat DOWN until the milk is just simmering</p>
	<p>Step 6: Cook for 5 minutes on each side (there are 6 sides, pick the two biggest). Stir occationally</p>
	<p>Step 7: Steak should be cooked hard over, if its only soft boiled, cook for 2 more minutes.</p>
	<p>Step 8: Cool steak for 4 minutes on serving dish</p>
	<p>Step 9: Garnish with jelly beans</p>
	<p>Step 10: Bon Appétit!</p>
